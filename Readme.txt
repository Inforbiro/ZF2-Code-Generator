ABOUT ZF CODE GENERATOR
===========================

The ZF Code Generator is a web interface for automatic code creation.

Currently, it is suported only module code generator and new features will be implemented in the future (models, forms, controllers...).

REQUIREMENTS AND NOTES
===========================

- The ZF Code Generator is created for Zend Framework 2 and can't be used with the previous ZF version.

- Up and running ZF2 application (e.g. Skeleton Application). Because ZF Code Generator is a module itself it requires working application, i.e. the module doesn't create an application but modules only

- The ZF Code Generator is not a part of the ZF Tool nor can be run using command line (maybe in the future).

- The module has it's own layout and assets

- Created view file will be empty, it's up to you to modify it

- It is strongly recommended to use the module on a development environment only!

INSTALLATION
===========================

- Extract the folder's content into module/Codegenerator folder

- Copy content of the module's public folder into application public folder

- Add valid permissions to the module's folder, if necessary

- Add the module name in the application config file (config/application.config.php), in order to "activate" the module, e.g.:

...
'modules' => array(
	'Application',
	...,
	'Codegenerator', <-- Add this line
    ),
...

- That's it! You are now ready to create new modules auto-magically.
